# Postgres - Automated container with seed data file

This project is a very simple example of how you can execute an image of Postgres with an initial set of data.

## How

## Steps

This project can be divided into three different moments.

- **Dockerfile** - Containing the image construction where we feed the entry point with sql scripts.
- **Script execution** - This scripts will execute when the container is started.
- **Docker compose file** - File used to define services to execute (in this case we'll only have a Postgres service from the previous Dockerfile)

## Usage

Run the following command to start the service

```docker
docker-compose up --build -d
```

Now you can use any database admin tool to see the data created on the database.

Configurations:

- Host:Port = localhost:15432
- Database_name = please_db
- User/password = admin/admin
